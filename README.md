# Welcome to jupyterbook.pub (name tbd)

## Why?

When you are using JupyterBook, I think of three distinct activities (roughly speaking):

1. Authoring (you're writing your content, iterating on it)
1. Publishing (your *source* content is pushed somewhere like GitHub, Zenodo, etc)
1. Rendering (your *source* content is rendered into something more human readable, via GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc)

(3) feels like *accidental complexity*, as it forces you to understand and deal with things that are not core to the
process of writing. The goal of this project is to reduce this accidental complexity to 0 as much as possible, and
then see what additional possible things can be built on top of this.
